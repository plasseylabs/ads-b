Perl ADS-B decoder written in pre RTL2832U era

This is a very old code written in 2010 based on ADS-B protocol documentation.
This project was developed in pre-RTL2832U era (at least for me :) )and it was only a feasibility test.
It was a hobby project written during a two week holiday with an intension to be implemented in C if succeded.
This code is not maintained and for the real plane-spotting enthusiasts I would recommend to use
an application by Salvatore Sanfilippo https://github.com/antirez/dump1090
